# Calculator 

## First of All

First of all, I'm sorry for my poor english. I will try write everything in english from this project, but I'm still learning, and maybe some comments in code will be on portuguese.

A fun fact, if some native english read this. I guess some people joke about something like "the guy that says 'i'm sorry for poor english' before speak something 'gallant'/'far-fetched', because some languages, like portuguese, are very based in latin, so when we try to translate the words of our language to english(the natural way of learning another language) they seems far-fetched. Far-fetched surely is a word that I never read before in english, but reminded me of the pokemon.


## Goal

This project goal is practice react creating a responsive(in multiple meanings) page with a simple calculator. I will in the future improve this project, so, it's still on progress.

## Future Fixes and Improvements

Fix the "- 0.5", the 0 is going 'invisible'
Verify if eval really will not give problems with try catch.

## Template

Vite + React
